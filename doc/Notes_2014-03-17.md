Intro to Conditionals
---------------------

A whirlwind tour of Conditionals; the way you make your program change its
behavior based on *conditions* which we may not know until *runtime*. We covered:

`if/else` statements:
```if (CONDITION) {
  // Do this if CONDITION is true
} else {
  // Do this if CONDITION is false
}```
