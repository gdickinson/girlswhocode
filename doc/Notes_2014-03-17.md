Intro to Conditionals
---------------------

A whirlwind tour of Conditionals; the way you make your program change its
behavior based on *conditions* which we may not know until *runtime*. We covered:

`if/else` statements:

```javascript
if (CONDITION) {
  // Do this if CONDITION is true
} else {
  // Do this if CONDITION is false
}
```

Chaining multiple `if` statements with `if else`:

```javascript
if (CONDITION) {
  // Run if CONDITION is true
} else if (ANOTHER CONDITION) {
  // Run this if CONDITION is false and ANOTHER CONDITION is true
} else {
  // Run this is neither CONDITION nor ANOTHER CONDITION are true
}
```

Comparisons:

```javascript
=== // equality
< // less than
> // greater than
>= // greater than or equal to
<= // less than or equal to
! // negation
```

Logical Operators

```javascript
&& // AND
|| // OR
! // NOT
```
